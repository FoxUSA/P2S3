        <p>This utility does not save your credentials. Your browser is communicating with AWS directly. This utility is also open source so the community can audit the code.</p>
        <p>The url generated only allows a specific file type, you specify the location it will be uploaded, and will expire at a configured time. If you enable encryption at link creation, we will tell S3 to encrypt the object server side with AES 256 using the default key in AWS KMS.</p>
